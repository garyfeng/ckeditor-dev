<p>Why do we need a plug-in for keystroke logging? Well, see if <a href="http://draftback.com/">http://draftback.com/</a> answers your question.</p>

<p>As a cognitive scientist interested in the writing process, I began to study keystrokes of writers years ago. There are a number of tools developed specifically for keystroke research, notably </p>

<ul>
<li>this</li>
<li>that</li>
</ul>

<p>But one drawback is that they tend to be specialized software not suitable to study writing in the wild. </p>

<p>Speaking of the wild, we probably have reach a point where we do more writing online than in dedicated word processing programs such as WordStar (what's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">that</a>, you might ask). We need a tool to capture keystrokes online. </p>

<p>Which brings us to CKeditor, one of the most popular open source WYSIWYG editors. The goal of this project is to develop a method for keystroke logging (and playback) on CKeditor. </p>

<a id="why-ckeditor" class="anchor" href="#why-ckeditor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why CKeditor?</h3>

<p>That's one of the two places I could start with, the other being <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a>. </p>

<h3>
<a id="why-a-plug-in" class="anchor" href="#why-a-plug-in" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why a plug-in?</h3>

<p>In order to log keystrokes and any other editing actions that may alter the content of your writing, you will need to hook eventListners of sorts to all kinds of things -- keyboard events, mouse right clicks, toolbar buttons, keyboard shortcuts, spell checkers, you name it. Imagine the hairy mess when you have to touch every piece of the editor code in order to hook them up. </p>

<p>Well, there is a better solution, at least in CKeditor, which is through the plug-in mechanism. See the code for yourself. </p>

<p>The plug-in code is developed by Gary Feng (<a href="https://github.com/garyfeng" class="user-mention">@garyfeng</a>), based on the excellent work by contributors of the CKeditor and its plug-ins. </p>
